# kit-ilias-shortcut

This app lets you generate a custom link that you can add to the site search configuration of your browser. After that you can enter a custom keyword in your omnibox followed by a search query. This search query will redirect you to one of your Ilias courses. The query can either be an exact match with a previously specified abbreviation or a prefix of a course name. All data is stored in your custom link. The API just redirects based on the query. Being a KIT student and using a chromium browser is required.
